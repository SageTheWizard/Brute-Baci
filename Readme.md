# BRUTE-BACI
Little script that will compile your .cm and run the pco all in one
## How To?
Move the brute-baci.sh to /usr/local/bin unless you wanna have a bad time<br/>
You might have to run chmod +x on it, I dunno, I had to.<br/>
Make sure your "bacc" and "bainterp" are also in /usr/local/bin<br/>
## Usage
the command is as follows (no quotes): "brute-baci.sh sample.cm"<br/>
so to compile and run onetwo.cm it would be "brute-baci.sh onetwo.cm" <br/>
## Sample Output:
